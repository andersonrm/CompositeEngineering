# CompositeEngineering


Engineering composite parts.

This repo contains analyses and comparisons of different materials and structures used in marine applications.

Eventually, I will develop a Shiny app that will allow users to quickly toggle through engineering choices in the design process for building composite structures. The first project will focus on sandwich construction of beams. Users will be able to adjust parameters such as span length, load force, core thickness, skin thickness, skin modulus, and beam width. Results will be displayed graphically, illustrating beam deflection given the parameters. Face yield and core shear will be calculated as well.

Output from this app should only be considered a first step in the engineering process. I assume no liability for design validity and by using this app, you acknowledge this. Additionally, material properties for composites can vary widely from the designed (or theoretical) properties. This variation can arise at any step in the manufacturing process from fabric supplier to layup techniques to post-curing. Errors in the construction compound and substantial safety factors should be implemented and adjusted for the intended use.
